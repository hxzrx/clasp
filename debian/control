Description: Common Lisp implementation that brings Common Lisp and C++ Together
	Clasp is a new Common Lisp implementation that seamlessly interoperates
	with C++ libraries and programs using LLVM for compilation to native
	code. This allows Clasp to take advantage of a vast array of preexisting
	libraries and programs, such as out of the scientific computing
	ecosystem. Embedding them in a Common Lisp environment allows you to
	make use of rapid prototyping, incremental development, and other
	capabilities that make it a powerful language.
